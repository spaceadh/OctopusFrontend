# 🐙 Octopus Platform – Projects Overview

Octopus is a **multi-legged SaaS platform** designed to unify critical business operations (property, lending, sacco, chama, identity/auth) under one umbrella.
Think of it as an ecosystem where each "leg" (module) is a product, but all plug into a central shell for **auth, subscription, and navigation**.

---

## 🎯 Vision

To provide businesses, cooperatives, landlords, and financial institutions with a **single entry point** for managing multiple operational workflows, while still allowing each module to operate **independently** if sold as a standalone product.

---

## 🛠️ Core Modules

### 1. Identity Service

* Central authentication & authorization hub.
* Handles login, JWT tokens, password resets.
* Subscription enforcement (which modules/products a user can access).
* Inter-service authentication for secure cross-module communication.

---

### 2. Property Management

* Manage properties, houses, units.
* Track tenants, leases, payments.
* Maintenance requests + notifications.
* Dashboard for landlords/managers.

---

### 3. Lending Engine

* Loan origination, disbursement, repayment tracking.
* Credit scoring hooks (future ML integration).
* Borrower portal + repayment reminders.
* Outbox pattern for financial events → other services.

---

### 4. Sacco Management

* Member onboarding + contributions.
* Loan processing tied to sacco rules.
* Dividend allocation + reporting.
* Integration with lending engine for sacco-based loans.

---

### 5. Chama Management

* Group savings & rotating credit system.
* Contribution tracking, meeting notes, payouts.
* Role-based permissions (chair, treasurer, secretary).
* Option to integrate with Sacco + Lending.

---

## 🌍 Shared Infrastructure

* **Subscriptions:** Users tied to one or more modules via subscription plans (FREE, PRO, ENTERPRISE).
* **Global Navbar:** Switch across modules based on subscription.
* **Theming & Branding:** Dark/light mode, tenant branding, custom logo support.
* **Localization (i18n):** English, Swahili, French support.
* **Observability:** Centralized metrics, logs, traces across services.

---

## 📦 Architecture Highlights

* **Backend:** Go microservices (stateless, Dockerized, 12-factor).
* **Frontend:** React micro-frontends with shell + plugins (per module).
* **Messaging:** Kafka for async comms & event-driven workflows.
* **Database:** Postgres per service, migrations managed per module.
* **Infra:** Docker Compose for local dev → Kubernetes (future scale).

---

## 🚀 Developer Experience

* Each module has its own repo structure but plugs into Octopus.
* Docker Compose spins up the whole ecosystem locally (DB + Kafka + Services + Frontend).
* GitHub Actions CI/CD per service + per frontend module.
* Standardized logging, metrics, error handling.

---

## 🧭 Roadmap

1. ✅ Scaffold identity-service (auth + subscriptions).
2. 🚧 Bootstrap frontend shell (Octopus UI) with product switcher.
3. 🚧 Add property-service + plugin.
4. 🚧 Add sacco-service + chama-service.
5. 🚧 Add lending engine + advanced workflows.
6. 🔮 Future: AI-powered insights (vacancy prediction, loan scoring, risk detection).

---

## 🏁 Summary

Octopus is **not just one product**. It’s a **platform** with multiple modules (legs) that can run together or independently, giving flexibility in **B2B SaaS sales strategy**:

* **Bundle mode** → full ecosystem for institutions.
* **Standalone mode** → individual module sold as SaaS.

🐙 Many legs, one brain.
