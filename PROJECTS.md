# 🐙 Octopus Platform – Projects Overview

Octopus is a **multi-legged SaaS platform** designed to unify critical business operations (property, lending, sacco, chama, identity/auth) under one umbrella.
Think of it as an ecosystem where each "leg" (module) is a product, but all plug into a central shell for **auth, subscription, and navigation**.

---

## 🎯 Vision

To provide businesses, cooperatives, landlords, and financial institutions with a **single entry point** for managing multiple operational workflows, while still allowing each module to operate **independently** if sold as a standalone product.

---

## 🛠️ Core Modules

### 1. Identity Service

* Central authentication & authorization hub.
* Handles login, JWT tokens, password resets.
* Subscription enforcement (which modules/products a user can access).
* Inter-service authentication for secure cross-module communication.

---

### 2. Property Management

* Manage properties, houses, units.
* Track tenants, leases, payments.
* Maintenance requests + notifications.
* Dashboard for landlords/managers.

---

### 3. Lending Engine

* Loan origination, disbursement, repayment tracking.
* Credit scoring hooks (future ML integration).
* Borrower portal + repayment reminders.
* Outbox pattern for financial events → other services.

---

### 4. Sacco Management

* Member onboarding + contributions.
* Loan processing tied to sacco rules.
* Dividend allocation + reporting.
* Integration with lending engine for sacco-based loans.

---

### 5. Chama Management

* Group savings & rotating credit system.
* Contribution tracking, meeting notes, payouts.
* Role-based permissions (chair, treasurer, secretary).
* Option to integrate with Sacco + Lending.

---

## 🌍 Shared Infrastructure

* **Subscriptions:** Users tied to one or more modules via subscription plans (FREE, PRO, ENTERPRISE).
* **Global Navbar:** Switch across modules based on subscription.
* **Theming & Branding:** Dark/light mode, tenant branding, custom logo support.
* **Localization (i18n):** English, Swahili, French support.
* **Observability:** Centralized metrics, logs, traces across services.

---

## 📦 Architecture Highlights

* **Backend:** Go microservices (stateless, Dockerized, 12-factor).
* **Frontend:** React micro-frontends with shell + plugins (per module).
* **Messaging:** Kafka for async comms & event-driven workflows.
* **Database:** Postgres per service, migrations managed per module.
* **Infra:** Docker Compose for local dev → Kubernetes (future scale).

---

## 🚀 Developer Experience

* Each module has its own repo structure but plugs into Octopus.
* Docker Compose spins up the whole ecosystem locally (DB + Kafka + Services + Frontend).
* GitHub Actions CI/CD per service + per frontend module.
* Standardized logging, metrics, error handling.

---

## 🧭 Roadmap

1. ✅ Scaffold identity-service (auth + subscriptions).
2. 🚧 Bootstrap frontend shell (Octopus UI) with product switcher.
3. 🚧 Add property-service + plugin.
4. 🚧 Add sacco-service + chama-service.
5. 🚧 Add lending engine + advanced workflows.
6. 🔮 Future: AI-powered insights (vacancy prediction, loan scoring, risk detection).

---

## 🏁 Summary

Octopus is **not just one product**. It’s a **platform** with multiple modules (legs) that can run together or independently, giving flexibility in **B2B SaaS sales strategy**:

* **Bundle mode** → full ecosystem for institutions.
* **Standalone mode** → individual module sold as SaaS.

🐙 Many legs, one brain.

# Color Schema

Core Brand Colors (Trust & Professionalism)

Deep Navy – #0D1B2A → Serious, authoritative, financial tone.

Azure Blue – #1B9AAA → Modern, tech-forward, energetic.

Bright Cyan – #3DD6D0 → Innovation, freshness, SaaS energy.

Secondary Accent Colors (Modules / Products)

Each product can take an accent for visual separation while staying in the Octopus family:

Property → Emerald Green #2D6A4F

Lending → Golden Amber #FFB703

Sacco → Royal Purple #6A4C93

Chama → Coral Red #E63946

(These accents will mostly show up in dashboards, icons, or charts per module.)

Neutrals (Background + UI)

Light Mode Background → #F8FAFC (cool gray-50)

Dark Mode Background → #0B0C10

Surface (cards, modals) → #FFFFFF (light), #1F2937 (dark)

Text Primary → #111827 (light), #F9FAFB (dark)

Text Muted → #6B7280 (gray-500)

Success / Warning / Error States

Success → Green #16A34A

Warning → Yellow #F59E0B

Error → Red #DC2626

Info → Blue #2563EB

🖼️ Tone & Feel

Professional but inviting → Think Azure meets Notion.

Scalable design language → Each module can adopt an accent color while keeping the core Octopus identity.

Dark mode first (feels modern, developer-friendly), but with an excellent light theme fallback.

Flat + minimal components (no skeuomorphism).

Typography → Inter (modern SaaS standard) or IBM Plex Sans (for B2B seriousness).

🌍 Theming Strategy

Global Theme Tokens (e.g., primary, secondary, accent, neutral, surface).

Module Override → Each product gets its accent injected via context/theme provider.

Tenant Branding → Allow enterprises to override logo + primary/secondary palette.

Dark/Light Mode → Persistent toggle in navbar.

⚡️ Summary:
Octopus’ design language should scream: modular, trustworthy, adaptable. Navy + teal/cyan as the core tech identity, with accents per module so users instantly know which “leg” of the octopus they’re in, but without losing the umbrella brand.
